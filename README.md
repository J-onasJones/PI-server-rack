# PI-server-rack
A system that allows Monitoring of Raspberry PI('s) PC and Mac as well as controlling their cooling fans.

## Why?
The idea was to create software to allow the different components inside my diy Raspberry PI server rack to communicate which each other. This is done with serial connections as they are very easy to set up and use.
